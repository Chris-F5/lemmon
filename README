This project is in a broken and experimental state right now.

I dont remember fully what the plan was... I think it was something to do
with creating a new kind of human-computer user interface paradigm
in which a drawing tablet replaces mouse and we do away with windows and
hierarchical filesystems. A bit crazy.
